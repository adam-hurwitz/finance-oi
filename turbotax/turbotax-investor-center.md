# About
- Site: [investor-center.app.intuit.com/ttic](https://investor-center.app.intuit.com/ttic)
- Free tool to track cryptocurrency (crypto) transactions (txs).
- Built initially by TaxBit: [An Important Announcement Regarding TaxBitâ€™s Consumer Platform](https://taxbit.com/blog/taxbit-consumer-platform-update/#an-important-announcement-regarding-tax-bit-s-consumer-platform) *by TaxBit*

# Opportunities
## Prioritization key
- P0: Important and time-sensitive blocker in moving forward
- P1: Important and and not as time-sensitive
- P2: Nice to have currently
- P3: Nice to have in the future

## CSV uploads (P0)
- For networks and centralized exchanges (CEXs) that aren't supported through the API
- E.g. [Importing Transaction Histories to CoinTracker Using CSVs](https://support.cointracker.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413071299729-Importing-Transaction-Histories-to-CoinTracker-Using-CSVs) *by CoinTracker*

## "Add a missing date, time, or amount" view (P0)
- Show the full cryptocurrency address for each item.
- It is very difficult to debug transactions without the account address information for each transaction.

## Upload errors with accounts still showing (P1)
- There's no way to see what transactions and/or tokens caused the error in order to resolve manually
- [Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses, Coinbase and Gemini upload errors 2024-01-04](https://drive.proton.me/urls/D1WTDJEZY0#R1HY6HzMnj8x)
- Transactions potentially show after the error messages displays

## Bulk add addresses (P1)
- Add a list of addresses in the "Add an account" view
- Adding dozens of addresses takes a long time

## Sources to add
### Networks (P1)
- Solana
- Gnosis Chain
- Arweave
- Dash
- Stellar

### Centralized exchanges CEXs (P2)
- Ledn
- For historical transactions (txs) for US users
    - Binance.com
    - Bitfinex
    - FTX US
    - Voyager
