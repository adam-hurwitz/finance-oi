## Bitcoin

- Hierarchical deterministic (HD) accounts
    - A new address is generated per transaction for security purposes
    - To research: Ledger, Trezor, and other wallet's strategy to accurately track HD accounts
    - Potential solution: Integrate directly with hierarchical deterministic (HD) accounts to pull read-only transaction data, e.g. Ledger and Trezor.
    - *See [What are Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets?](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-are-hierarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets) by Ledger 2022-10-27*

    - Lightning network
    - Bitcoin Liquid Network
